    <p class="text-justify">This was one of the most difficult, but rewarding 
        projects that I worked on during my time in film school. The assignment, 
        which was for my Sound 2 Class, was to select a script for an existing film 
        and adapted it into a 2-5 minute piece using only sound effects, voice over, 
        and music. No visuals.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">It was originally supposed to be a group project with me 
        and two other guys, but the bums couldnâ€™t be bothered to keep in touch or 
        contribute anything meaningful. Three weeks behind schedule with a week to go 
        before the project is due, I finally realize that the bums are never going to 
        contribute anything, so I take it upon myself to write the script for the project 
        and put it together all by myself. I spent countless hours in post production 
        labs at my school putting together as many sound effects, music cues, and voice 
        overs that I could scrounge together in a week. It was a grueling process, but 
        I was able to finish the project the night before it was due and ended up getting 
        the highest grade in the class.</p>


    <p class="text-justify">The source material for the 1971 film The Omega Man starring
         Charleton Heston. Based on the 1954 novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, the 
         film follows U.S. Army Colonel. Robert Neville, M.D. as he battles for his life 
         against an army of nocturnal mutants in the aftermath of a biological war between 
         Russia and China that has seemingly caused a plague that has infected the entire 
         planet, except for Neville.</p>
